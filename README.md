It will start with a stock of coins and dollars.  It will then repeatedly request the price for an item to be purchased or to quit.  If given a price, it will accept nickels, dimes, quarters, one-dollar and five-dollar bills deposited one at a time in payment.  When the user has deposited enough to cover the cost of the item, the program will calculate the coins to be dispensed in change.  Alternately, the user can cancel the purchase up until full payment has been deposited, in which case, your program will calculate the coins to be dispensed to refund any partial payment already deposited.  With each purchase, the program will update the stock of coins and dollars.  Before quitting, it will output the remaining stock of coins and dollars.  The specifications are spelled out more thoroughly below.  An example interaction with our program appears at the end of this description. All change and refunds must be in coins only, and must use the minimum number of coins possible.
